# HEIC Support

Allows .heic uploads to the Media Library. Creates a .webp copy of .heic images when they are uploaded.

Creation of .webp copies only works on servers running ImageMagick 7 or above. Check the page at Media â†’ HEIC Support after activating to see if your server provides ImageMagick 7.
